# LivPyLib
Hi there! This library exists for more easily importing other libraries! It's sort of akin to Tidyverse in R, but for python! It contains all of the common libraries I use frequently and may in the future contain some functions I make that I find commonly useful.

## Installation:
To install LivPyLib, use the following pip command:

```{python}
# Latest Version
pip install livpylib
```



## Usage:
To use LivPyLib, use the following python code:
```{python}
from livpylib import liv

# list options for selecting libs to import
liv.get_options()

# load libs (swap 'all' for desired option from list given in above function)
liv.lib('all')
```

## List of included libs:
Coming Soon!
